synopsis: WriteT and RWST monad transformers (Reexport with all dependencies)
description:
  The WriterT and RWST monad transformers provided by writer-cps-transformers
  are written in continuation passing style and avoid the space-leak
  problem of the traditional Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Strict and Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Lazy.
  This package reexports from writer-cps-transformers and provides all missing
  orphan instances, e.g. from mtl.
